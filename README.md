The Koala benchmark suite enables characterization of performance-oriented research targeting the POSIX shell. It consists of 14 real-world program sets from diverse domains ranging from CI/CD and AI/ML to biology and the humanities. They are accompanied by real inputs that facilitate small- and large-scale performance characterization and varying opportunities for optimization.

## Quick Setup

Koala can be obtained using the following ways:

* Run `curl up.kben.sh | sh` from your terminal,
* [Clone the repo](https://github.com/kbensh/koala) and run `cd koala && ./setup.sh`,
* Fetch the oficial Docker container by running `docker pull ghcr.io/kbensh/koala:latest`, or
* Build the Docker [container from scratch](#environment--setup-notes).

## More info

**Setup and configuration:** Extended instructions on Koala's setup and configuration can be found in the [INSTRUCTIONS](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.

**Inputs and dependencies:** Information on Koala's multiple inputs (e.g., min, small, and full)  as well as the dependencies of all benchmarks, can be found in the [INSTRUCTIONS](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.
