There are several ways to contribute to the Koala benchmark suite for the Shell.

## Improve existing benchmarks

Is there a specific setup under which the benchmarks do not work and validation fails? 
You can: 

1. Open an issue describing the problem. Try to be as detailed as possible, explaining which benchmark fails, at which point, and under what environment.
2. Create a pull request with a fix. If you are not sure how to fix it, you can also open an issue (look above) and ask for help.

## Add new benchmarks

Koala is an evolving suite and will try to stay relevant by incorporating new ways the shell is used. If you have a benchmark that you think is relevant, you can:

1. Open an issue describing the benchmark you want to add. Explain why it is relevant and how it can be useful for the community.
2. Create a pull request with the new benchmark. Make sure to follow the existing structure of the benchmarks. Keep it mind that new benchmarks will only be added after agreement from Koala's technical steering committee.
