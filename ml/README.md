This benchmark replicates the training process of a Scikit-Learn
`LogisticRegression` model using manually decomposed steps derived from
Scikit-Learnâ€™s internal source code and segments and classifies hieroglyphs in
a set of input images using pre-trained models.

### Inputs

The input dataset is the `Covtype` dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` module, which is a synthetic dataset with 58.1012 samples and 54 features.
Input size is inflated using the `SMOTE` algorithm to create a balanced dataset with 800M samples.
For the `dpt` section of the benchmark, `inputs/images/` contains the image files to be processed.

### Running

The benchmark simulates the entire `fit` pipeline using individual Python scripts that replicate Scikit-Learn internals:
- Generates training/test data.
- Constructs model, computes row norms, warm-start coefficients.
- Runs coefficient calculation in parallel over class labels.
- Assembles and stores the final model in `result/trained_model.obj`.

For the Hieroglyph image processing benchmark, the following steps are performed:

1. Segmentation:
   -  Regions of interest are extracted from the image using a pre-trained segmentation model.
  
2. Classification:
   -  Regions of interest are extracted from the image using a pre-trained segmentation model.

Results are written to a single output file and include:
- Image filename
- Bounding box coordinates for each detected region
- Hieroglyph classification labels
- Confidence scores for each prediction
All outputs are deterministic across runs.

### Validation

Correctness is validated by comparing each generated output file against a reference stored in the `hashes/` directory.
